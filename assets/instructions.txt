Game Title: Cahil Kim?
Overview:
"Who Is Cahil?" is a social party game where players must figure out which among them is the "ignorant" – the person who does not know the word that everyone else has been secretly shown. The game combines elements of bluffing, strategic thinking, and teamwork.

Number of Players:
3-8 players (The game works best with 5 or more players.)

Game Setup:
Start a New Game:
One player opens the "Cahil Kim?" app and selects the option to create a new game.
The game creator shares the generated game ID with all other players.
Other players join the game using the provided game ID.
Entering Player Names:
Each player enters their name into the app on their device.
Once all players have joined and entered their names, the game creator starts the game.
How to Play:
Word Assignment:
The app randomly selects a word from its database and shows it to all players, except for one – the "ignorant."
The ignorant player receives a screen that simply states, "You are Cahil," without showing the word.
Taking Turns:
Players take turns speaking a single sentence that hints at the word without being too obvious. The goal is to help others identify the ignorant without giving away the word directly.
The ignorant tries to blend in, pretending to know the word by also crafting a plausible sentence based on others' hints.
Guessing the Ignorant:
After a few rounds of hints (typically once each player has spoken twice), players vote on who they believe is the ignorant.
Votes are entered into the app, which then reveals who the ignorant player was and what the word was.
Winning the Game:
If the ignorant player avoids detection (receives the fewest votes), they win the game.
If the ignorant is correctly identified, all other players win collectively.
Additional Rules:
No Repeating Sentences: Players must come up with unique hints each round.
No Direct Definitions: Avoid giving direct definitions of the word.
Time Limit: Optionally, set a time limit for each hint to keep the game pace lively.
Game End:
The game can continue with new rounds by selecting new words and assigning the role of ignorant to different players each time.
Players can choose to end the game session after any number of rounds.
Strategy Tips:
For the Ignorant: Pay close attention to the hints given by others. Use this information to craft your sentences smartly to avoid detection.
For Other Players: Be subtle with your hints. Being too obvious might help the ignorant guess the word.
